To remove changes in Git before committing, you have several options depending on whether the changes are unstaged, staged, or both. Below are solutions for each scenario:
Undo Changes in Working Directory (Unstaged)

    To discard all local changes to tracked files, use:

text
git restore .

For older Git versions, use:

text
git checkout -- .

This restores the working directory to the last commit, deleting modifications to all tracked files.

​

To discard changes in a specific file:

text
git restore <file>

Or for older versions:

    text
    git checkout -- <file>

Undo Staged Changes

    To unstage files you previously added to the staging area (with git add) but haven’t committed yet:

text
git restore --staged .

Or, for older Git:

text
git reset

This will move staged files back to unstaged without discarding the changes.

    ​

Completely Remove All Local Changes (Including Staged/Unstaged)

    To undo all changes and reset your repository to the last commit, removing everything (dangerous and unrecoverable):

text
git reset --hard

This discards all changes in the working directory and the staging area.

    ​

Handle Untracked Files

    To remove untracked files (files not added to Git yet):

text
git clean -fd

This deletes every untracked file, so use with caution.

    ​

Using Git Stash (Temporarily Save Changes)

    You can also stash your changes if you want to remove them from working state but potentially reuse them later:

text
git stash
